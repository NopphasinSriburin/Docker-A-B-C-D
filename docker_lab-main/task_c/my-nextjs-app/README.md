## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.

### Building the Docker Image

To prepare the Docker image for the Next.js application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
docker build -t job-b-nodejs .
```

### Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container with the following command:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 job-b-nodejs
```

### Accessing the Application

After running the container, you can access the Next.js application in your web browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the homepage rendered by the Next.js application.

## Main Directory for Website Files

The main place to put the website files is in the `src/pages` directory, where each file corresponds to a route in the application.

## Conclusion

This README provides a basic overview of the Next.js application and instructions for running it in a Docker container. For further development, you can add more pages and components as needed.
